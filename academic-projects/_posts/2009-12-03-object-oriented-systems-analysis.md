### Object-Oriented Systems Analysis

> UML, Microsoft Visio, Pencil (GUI Prototyping)

* Worked with a team to create a Systems Requirements Specification document for the Columbus Department of Recreation and Parks.
* SRS was based on a needed update of a system used to keep track of trees in Columbus.
* Various UML methods were used including use case diagrams, scenarios, prototypes and class diagrams.
Presented a section of our SRS to the client at the end of the quarter.
